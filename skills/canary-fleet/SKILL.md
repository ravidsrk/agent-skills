# Canary-Fleet — post-deploy monitor on Orca

## ⚠️ HARD BASE: Orca `orchestration`

**This skill is built on Orca orchestration — we have Orca; we do not replace it.**

| Layer | Owns | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Runtime** | tasks, dispatch, `worker_done`, gates, DAG, worktrees | Orca |
| **Grammar** | CLI + lifecycle | **`orchestration` skill from Orca CLI** (not this repo) |
| **This skill** | *what / when / why* | this repo |
| **Worker methodology** | gstack / Matt playbooks injected into workers | garrytan/gstack, mattpocock/skills |

**Preflight:** `orca status --json` · orchestration experimental on · `orchestration` skill loaded · never substitute in-process Task/subagents for `task-create` + `dispatch`.

**Full handoff** → `orca-cli` unless user asked to supervise / wait for `worker_done`.


## Process
```
INPUT: production/staging URL + success criteria
  → canary worker loop (browse/health endpoints, duration/budget)
  → on breach: escalation + incident draft issue
  → decision_gate for rollback/mitigation (human)
```

## Rules
- Observe and report by default.
- Auto-mitigation only if user pre-authorized a runbook step in the TASK.
- Pair after `gstack-ship-fleet` land phase.

## Scripts & assets

- `scripts/spawn_worker.sh` · `preflight.py` · `pm.py` — call Orca
- `assets/*_preamble.txt` — worker roles
- `references/ledger-template.md` — copy to `docs/<skill>-progress.md`

Workers should load **gstack** skills when the TASK names them (`/review`, `/qa-only`, `/cso`, …). Install: `git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`
